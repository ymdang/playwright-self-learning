Overview
This repository contains my hands-on experience with Playwright, a powerful tool for automating web browsers. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in test automation using Playwright, following best practices and incorporating concepts like Page Object Model (POM), test reporting, and UI verification.

Features:
- Test Automation: Various UI test scripts that navigate, interact with, and validate web pages.
- Page Object Model (POM): Implemented POM to separate the logic of page interactions from test cases.
- Playwright Testing: Uses Playwright's modern browser automation to run tests on multiple browsers.
- Reports: Allure for test reports and Playwright's built-in trace functionality to view test execution and troubleshoot issues.

# Playwright Self-Learning Project
