**Playwright Self-Learning Project**
This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience with Playwright, an open-source browser automation library for end-to-end testing. I created this project to learn how to use Playwright for automating web applications and performing tests.

**Features:**
- Test Automation: Various UI test scripts that navigate, interact with, and validate web pages.
- Page Object Model (POM): Implemented POM to separate the logic of page interactions from test cases.
- Playwright Testing: Uses Playwright's modern browser automation to run tests on multiple browsers.
- Reports: Allure for test reports and Playwright's built-in trace functionality to view test execution and troubleshoot issues.

**Technologies Used**
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - A Node.js library for browser automation
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor

**Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/ymdange/playwright-self-learning.git
   cd playwright-self-learning

**pre-reg:**
Node.js installed
Set up Playwright browsers

**Test Execution:**
npx playwright test

This will execute the test cases written in the tests folder.
